Follow official documentation from the upstream fork to install and run, only DON'T USE PRECOMPILED WHEEL or it wont works.

NVIADIA haven't yet compiled most of the official wheel for the newest version of the libraries used in this software, here I had to do for myself and sharing: cheers.

Compiled Wheels for the Jetson Orin AGX SM87 Cuda 12.6: https://github.com/martinobettucci/FramePack-Jetson/releases/tag/Jetson-Orin-JP62-r36.4
